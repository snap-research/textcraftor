Credits:

This library concretizes previous work by many different authors and would not have been possible without their great research and implementations. We'd like to thank, in particular, the following implementations which have helped us in our development and without which the API could not have been as polished today:

@CompVis' latent diffusion models library, available here
@hojonathanho original DDPM implementation, available here as well as the extremely useful translation into PyTorch by @pesser, available here
@ermongroup's DDIM implementation, available here
@yang-song's Score-VE and Score-VP implementations, available here

We also want to thank @heejkoo for the very helpful overview of papers, code and resources on diffusion models, available here as well as @crowsonkb and @rromb for useful discussions and insights.
